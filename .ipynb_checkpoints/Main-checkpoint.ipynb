    "**Introduction**<br>\n",
    "We have all seen the rise in number of forest fires in the past few years and scinetists and climate activists alike all over the world have raised their concerns regarding the same. While natural in few ecosystems, these recent forest fires root their cause to the global rise in temperature and poor land management by authorities. Due to this no matter whether a wildfire's origin is due to human intervention or natural, the drier climate makes it easy for it to spread over a region quite intensely. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "These fires are clear indicators that for change because not only do they sometimes do irreparable damge to forest ecosystems but also the gases released due to these fires travel to the city causing health crises. While governments all over the world introduce initiatives to promote sustatinable practices and the general public abides by them, it is also important for scienitsts to know which forests are prone to fires. Through this project we intend to answer the question **_insert question_**.<br>\n"

Let's take a look at what these variables are and how they help us indicate the chances of a forest fire.**(this part will be written once Method is completely written to see how many words can still fit)**."

    "As we, humans, fail to take actions against what causes these forest fires to happen so frequently, we need indicators which can help assist authorities in tackling this man-made disaster. Not only will these help firefighters understand whether there is a possibility of a forest fire passing onto a different region (given region's predictors) but also help scientists determine regions prone to fires.<br>\n",
    "One important question after proecessing the entire data above would be whether there are more factors we can consider which can help understand nature of fires better or do we go on building better models with the given predictors.\n"
